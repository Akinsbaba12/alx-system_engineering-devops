* ### Shell Basics ###
  * [0x00-shell_basics](./0x00-shell_basics): shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/). Nowadays, we have [graphical user interfaces](https://www.javatpoint.com/gui-operating-system) `GUIs` in addition to [command line interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) `CLIs` such as the [shell.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing))
* ### Shell Permissions ###
  * [0x01-shell_permissions](./0x01-shell_permissions): The [Unix-like operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like#:~:text=Some%20well%2Dknown%20examples%20of,used%20on%20Unix%2Dlike%20systems.), such as [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/) differ from other computing systems in that they are not only multitasking but also multi-user.
* ### Shell Redirections ###
  * [0x02-shell_redirections](./0x02-shell_redirections): we will explore a powerful feature used by command line programs called [input/output redirection.](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-input-output-redirection) as we have seen, many commands such as `ls` print their output on the display. This does not have to be the case, however. By using some special notations we can redirect the output of many commands to files, devices, and even to the input of other commands.
* ### Shell Variables Expansions ###
  * [0x03-shell_variables_expansion](./0x03-shell_variables_expansion): Each time we type a command line and press the enter key, bash performs several processes upon the text before it carries out our command. We have seen a couple of cases of how a simple character sequence, for example `*` can have a lot of meaning to the shell. The process that makes this happen is called `expansion.` With expansion, we type something and it is expanded into something else before the shell acts upon it. To demonstrate what we mean by this, let's take a look at the `echo` command. [echo](https://www.javatpoint.com/echo-command#:~:text=In%20Linux%2C%20the%20echo%20command,to%20a%20file%20and%20screen.) is a shell builtin that performs a very simple task. It prints out its text arguments on `standard output`.
