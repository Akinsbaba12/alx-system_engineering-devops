* [0x00-shell_basics](./0x00-shell_basics): shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.
* [0x01-shell_permissions](./0x01-shell_permissions): The Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux differ from other computing systems in that they are not only multitasking but also multi-user.
* [0x02-shell_redirections](./0x02-shell_redirections): we will explore a powerful feature used by command line programs called input/output redirection. As we have seen, many commands such as ls print their output on the display. This does not have to be the case, however. By using some special notations we can redirect the output of many commands to files, devices, and even to the input of other commands.
* [0x03-shell_variables_expansion](./0x03-shell_variables_expansion): Each time we type a command line and press the enter key, bash performs several processes upon the text before it carries out our command. We have seen a couple of cases of how a simple character sequence, for example ‚Äú*‚Äù, can have a lot of meaning to the shell. The process that makes this happen is called expansion. With expansion, we type something and it is expanded into something else before the shell acts upon it. To demonstrate what we mean by this, let's take a look at the echo command. echo is a shell builtin that performs a very simple task. It prints out its text arguments on standard output

* As a child, have always been inquisitive to learn how things works and what components makes it function. Being part of ALX has given me privilege to know how to manually communicate with computer at the low level programming language.
