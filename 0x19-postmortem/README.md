# Issue Summary
# Duration:
- Start Time: November 01, 2023, 14:30 UTC
- End Time: November 01, 2023, 17:45 UTC

# Impact:
The outage affected the authentication service, resulting in users experiencing login failures. Approximately 30% of users were unable to access the system during the incident.

# Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication server, leading to an unexpected rejection of valid user credentials.

# Timeline
- 14:30 UTC: Issue Detected
The outage was initially detected through a spike in error rates reported by the monitoring system.

- 14:45 UTC: Investigation Initiated
Engineers initiated an investigation into the authentication service to identify the source of the increased error rates.

- 15:15 UTC: Misleading Path
Initial investigations focused on the database server due to its critical role in authentication. However, database logs indicated no unusual activity.

- 15:45 UTC: Escalation
As the issue persisted, the incident was escalated to the authentication service team to conduct a more detailed analysis.

- 16:30 UTC: Root Cause Identified
Engineers discovered a misconfiguration in the authentication server that was causing valid user credentials to be rejected. The misconfiguration occurred during a recent deployment.

- 17:00 UTC: Resolution
The misconfiguration was corrected, and the authentication service was restarted. Normal service was gradually restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution
# Root Cause:
The misconfiguration was traced to an incomplete deployment script that failed to update the authentication server's configuration file. This caused the server to reject incoming user credentials, even when valid.

# Resolution:
The resolution involved correcting the misconfiguration in the authentication server's configuration file. Additionally, a more robust deployment process was implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
# Improvements/Fixes:

- Enhanced Deployment Process: Implement a more robust deployment process with additional checks and validations to prevent incomplete configurations.

- Automated Testing: Introduce automated testing of critical functionalities during the deployment process to catch configuration errors before reaching production.

- Monitoring Improvements: Enhance monitoring capabilities to quickly detect and alert on misconfigurations or anomalies in real-time.

# Tasks to Address the Issue:

- Configuration Review: Conduct a comprehensive review of all configuration files for critical services to ensure accuracy and completeness.

- Documentation Update: Update deployment documentation to include explicit instructions on configuration file updates and checks.

- Training: Provide training sessions for the operations team to enhance their awareness of potential misconfiguration issues and how to address them promptly.

- Incident Response Plan: Review and update the incident response plan to include specific procedures for handling misconfigurations and their root causes.

## In conclusion, the outage was a result of a misconfiguration during a deployment process, leading to a disruption in the authentication service. The incident highlighted the importance of robust deployment procedures, thorough monitoring, and continuous improvement in preventing and resolving such issues promptly. The corrective measures and tasks outlined aim to strengthen our system against similar incidents in the future.
